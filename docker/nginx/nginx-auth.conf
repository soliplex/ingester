# Nginx configuration for OAuth2 Proxy integration
# This is an alternative to using oauth2-proxy as the main reverse proxy.
# Use this if you need nginx for additional features (caching, rate limiting, etc.)
#
# Architecture:
#   User -> Nginx:80/443 -> OAuth2 Proxy:4180 (auth check) -> Upstream services
